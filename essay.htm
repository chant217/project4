My morning commute to school begins when I leave the door of my apartment. I have to walk down endless flights of stairs to reach the bottom of the apartment building. The stairs in the building are designed to look like black cargo boxes it’s super weird! When I open up the door, I am welcomed with a cool breeze. Its super chilly now and I kind of want to cry. So I reach into my bag and take out my phone and headphones and start listening to music to make the commute more bearable. I walk down the street past a bunch of cute little houses with fences, one of them has a garden gnome. The floor is all covered in red and yellow leaves. I turn left and pass a deli, the guy who runs the store always waves hi to me and I feel bad for not knowing his name. The street is filled with auto repair shops but they aren't open yet. The doors are all covered in cool graffiti. I reach the end of my friend Diana’s street and she is waiting for me to get breakfast. We quickly walk to the deli next to the train and check city mapper to see if our train is here yet. Theres still another 10 minutes until the next train arrives so we both decide to get a bacon egg and cheese. We walk around towards the drinks section and both grab coffees. Once our food is ready we run towards the station. Theres a stop light that takes forever so i’m feeling very stressed out. We walk up the stairs onto the station platform. The station is elevated above ground so i’m still freezing cold but that means I get a nice scenic view for most of my 30 minute train ride. My favorite part of the ride is when the train goes across the Williamsburg bridge. When it’s bright and early the train is really nicely lit and prevents you from falling asleep. The sun shines brightly on the Manhattan skyline. When the train finally reaches Manhattan, it goes underground and the train seems darker and gloomier. This kind of ruins my mood as it reminds me I have a long day of work ahead of me. After a few stops, I finally reach the 14th street station and begin my walk to school.
